F360 file made by @Logan#2225 and Solidworks file made by @Jake#1088


Usage:

Enter your steel width dimension in the part. For the F360 part this is done in "Parameters", in Solidworks it is done in "Manage Equations" You'll want to print 3 or 4 of them and place them across the length of your rail to center it on the steel beams.
