# Spindle Drill Jig by @rcw#0895

Tool designed in FreeCAD 0.18

Printing Instructions:
* Print out two spindle-mount-drill-jig-hoop.stl
* Print out one spindle-mount-drill-jig-back.stl

Usage:

Use M5 bolts anywhere from 15 to 35mm in length. If your 3D printer prints holes too tight to allow the M5 bolts to thread into the hoop, drill those out to 4.2mm or slightly larger. Clamp the spindle into the VFD clamp, leaving room on both the top and bottom of the spindle. Place the hoops in a vertical "U" orientation (on their flats), place the spindle and VFD clamp cradled in between them, place the back piece on top and fasten with the bolts until slack is taken up but the back plate is not bent under tension. Use the 4 other small (3mm) holes to pilot drill the holes in the back of the VFD clamp.
