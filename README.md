**Assembly Guide** and other Details you will find [here](Documentation/README.md)

**FAQ:** [here](Documentation/faq.md)

## Where to Start

1. Choose Nema 17 vs Nema 23 stepper motors: [see FAQ](Documentation/faq.md)
1. Define Size of Footprint and Beams: Calculator ([metric](https://threedesign.store/metric-frame-size-calculator/) / [imperial](https://threedesign.store/imperial-frame-size-calculator/))
1. Get the correct 3D printing files depending on the size and corner radius of your steel beams: [Download](Printed%20Parts/Kits) or get the Fusion360 [Assembly Tools](Printed%20Parts/Assembly%20Tools) and [Core Components](Printed%20Parts/Assembly%20Tools).
1. Get the right Z-Axis motor mount to print --> depending on the [z-Axis FacePlate](Drawings/FacePlatesDXF) and Motor Version: [Download](Printed%20Parts/Kits/). 
<br />For more information about cutting your own faceplate, files can be downloaded [here](https://threedesign.store/downloads/). To order a machined plate see the [official store](https://threedesign.store/store/?model_number=faceplate).
1. Collect remaining materials: [see BOM](Documentation/bom.md)
1. Assemble
